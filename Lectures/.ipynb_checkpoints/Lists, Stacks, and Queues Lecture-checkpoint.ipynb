    "## Using Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "List are a data structure that contain a sequence of elements $x_0,x_1,....x_{n-1}$ in which the size of the list is N. <br>\n",
    "There are many standard operations we can perform on a list such as inserting, appending, and removing an element. <br>\n",
    "We can easily implement a list using an array. Since arrays have a fixed size whenever we need more space we will create a copy of the array but double the size. Using arrays to implement list allows for accessing elements in constant time (O(1)), adding and removing elements is O(N). This is because when adding or removing elements from the front of an array requires shifting all the elements currently in the array to the right (adding) or left (removing). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Linked List\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid linear cost insertion and deletion we need to ensure that we can add and remove without shifting. We will try and solve this using a **linked list**. The idea is the list will contain a series of nodes which are not neccessarily adjacent to each in other in memory *(like an array)*, but instead each node will contain a pointer to it's neighbor. This allows for constant addition and removal since instead of shifting elements we now only need to change what node's pointer. <br>\n",

    "Here's removing an item from a linked list\n",

    "\n",
    "Here's adding an item to a linked list\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"files/linkedListAdd.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "However the issue with a **singly** linked list is that to remove the last element of a list we must find the n-1 element to change it's pointer. Even if we kept track of the head and tail nodes a search for the next to last element would have to be performed. To get around this we will use a **doubly linked list**. In a doubly linked list each node keeps track of both it's neighbors. This way when removing the last node we already have access to the next to last node. <br>\n",
    "The downfall of a linked list versus an array list is that finding an item takes at worst case O(N). Even with a doubly linked list and searching from both ends which results in only having to search half the list the upper bound on searching is still O(N). So the question when deciding which to use is more related to which trade off you're willing to sacrifice *accessing an item vs addition/removal of an item*\n",

We will also add a **peek** method which allows you to view the top of the stack without removing it. Also in our implementation we will use a singly linked list and perform some optimizations since for a stack we do not need all the methods a linked list needs."
